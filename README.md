# [Project 1: MA Thesis: Becoming fans of a Nation: Fandom Nationalism on Weibo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q9V5n2iaOt_tfi_GTSlRIa-vGHEusqsB/view?usp=sharing)

How is nationalism constructed? Scholars have theorized the construction of the idea of nationalism in contrasting ways. While modernization theorists have emphasized nationalism as political projects engineered by political groups during “unsettled” times, others have emphasized nationalism as a practice that involves everyday people making meanings about the nation during settled times. Through a case study of the “814 expedition”, I found the type of nationalism demonstrated in the 814 expedition did not fall into this rigid dichotomy. By exploring the interactions between the state actors, national identity, and fandom culture, I argue for a relational understanding of nationalism. While fandom nationalism as demonstrated in the 814 expedition did not serve a political purpose but only acted as a confirmation of Chinese identity and expression of patriotism, the efforts of the state actors in capitalizing on the expedition’s nationalistic content underlies the entanglement between patriotic expressions as an affirmation of pride and Chinese identity versus conservative state-supporting nationalism.

# [Project 2: Who are the top Influencers that spread Misinformation about COVID on Twitter?](https://github.com/VivianQian19/Twitter-Misinformation-Network)

How is misinformation about coronavirus spread on Twitter? In my research project, I aim to answer this question by taking advantages of large-scale computing tools such as PyWren and PySpark GraphFrames. The project can be broken down into two parts. The first part is collecting tweets using PyWren by mapping a scraper across a list of queries about misinformation. The second part of the project involves running large-scale network analysis of the retweet network of users who retweet misinformation using GraphFrames.


# [Project 3: Predicting Student Attrition](https://github.com/VivianQian19/Student-Attrition-Case-Study)
This case study uses four data sources. They are Financial Aid data, Static (demographic) data, and Progress data (which include student's GPA for each term), and finally a training set with studentID and labels of whether the student has dropped out. The goal of this case study is to use logistic regression, svm, and decision tree/ random forest to predict whehter or not a student will drop out and find a model with highest accuracy. In doing so, we can find out the best predicators that can explain student attrition. The dataset comes from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
