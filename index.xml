      <description>This case study uses four data sources. They are Financial Aid data, Static (demographic) data, and Progress data (which include student&amp;rsquo;s GPA for each term), and finally a training set with studentID and labels of whether the student has dropped out. The goal of this case study is to use logistic regression, svm, and decision tree/ random forest to predict whehter or not a student will drop out and find a model with highest accuracy.</description>

      <description>How is nationalism constructed? Scholars have theorized the construction of the idea of nationalism in contrasting ways. While modernization theorists have emphasized nationalism as political projects engineered by political groups during “unsettled” times, others have emphasized nationalism as a practice that involves everyday people making meanings about the nation during settled times. Through a case study of the “814 expedition”, I found the type of nationalism demonstrated in the 814 expedition did not fall into this rigid dichotomy.</description>

      <description>How is misinformation about coronavirus spread on Twitter? In my research project, I aim to answer this question by taking advantages of large-scale computing tools such as PyWren and PySpark GraphFrames. The project can be broken down into two parts. The first part is collecting tweets using PyWren by mapping a scraper across a list of queries about misinformation. The second part of the project involves running large-scale network analysis of the retweet network of users who retweet misinformation using GraphFrames.</description>
